In this repository, I keep my solutions to a coding questions I solved, while practicing.

The code here is written in **Java**.

Most of the questions are taken from https://leetcode.com/.

If there is an option to validate the solution easily, there will be tests also.

Note that some of the solutions here are probably not optimal, but they do solve the problems.
