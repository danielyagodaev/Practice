Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any node sequence from some starting node to any node in the tree along the
parent-child connections. The path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.

**Constraints**:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
