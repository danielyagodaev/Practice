Given a string _s_, you can convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the
shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

**Example 1:**

- Input: s = "aacecaaa"
- Output: "aaacecaaa"

**Example 2:**

- Input: s = "abcd"
- Output: "dcbabcd"

**Constraints:**

- _0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4_
- _s_ consists of lowercase English letters only.
