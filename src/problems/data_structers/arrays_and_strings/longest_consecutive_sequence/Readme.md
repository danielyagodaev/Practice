Given an unsorted array of integers _nums_, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

**Example 1:**

- Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
- Output: 4
- Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

**Example 2:**

- Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
- Output: 9

**Constraints:**

- _0 <= nums.length <= 10^4_
- _-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9_
