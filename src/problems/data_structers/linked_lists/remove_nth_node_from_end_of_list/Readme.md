Given the _head_ of a linked list, remove the _nth_ node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?

**Example 1:**

- Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
- Output: [1,2,3,5]

**Example 2:**

- Input: head = [1], n = 1
- Output: []

**Example 3:**

- Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
- Output: [1]

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
- _1 <= sz <= 30_
- _0 <= Node.val <= 100_
- _1 <= n <= sz_
